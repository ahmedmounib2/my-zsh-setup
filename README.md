## Important `.zshrc` Enhancements

- Over **15 developer-friendly aliases** for npm, git, docker, and more
- Adds `~/.npm-global/bin` to PATH for global npm binaries
- Instant prompt enabled for Powerlevel10k for faster shell startup
- Automatic Node.js version switching with FNM (Fast Node Manager)
- Custom `cdw` command to switch directories with WSL path conversion
- CI/CD shortcuts for GitHub and GitLab workflows
- Zinit configured to load plugins **in parallel** and **cache** compiled plugins for speed

## Node.js Version Management via FNM (Fast Node Manager)

This setup includes an **automatic Node.js version switcher** that reads `.nvmrc` files in your project directories and:

- Switches Node versions immediately on directory change (`cd`)
- Shows a colored message indicating the version switch
- Automatically installs missing Node versions
- Supports nested projects with their own `.nvmrc` files
- Silent and unobtrusive unless switching versions
- Fall back to NVM if FNM fails.

### How It Works (Inside `.zshrc`)

```zsh
eval "$(fnm env --use-on-cd)"

fnm_check_version() {
  local desired current
  [[ -f .nvmrc ]] && desired=$(<.nvmrc) || return
  current=$(node -v 2>/dev/null || echo "none")

  if [[ "$current" != "v$desired" ]]; then
    echo -e "\033[1;33m‚ö†Ô∏è Switching to Node v$desired\033[0m"
    fnm use "$desired" || fnm install "$desired"
  fi
}
add-zsh-hook chpwd fnm_check_version
```

## How To Use

- Add .nvmrc in your project root specifying Node version:

```bash
echo "20.19.0" > .nvmrc
```

- Or for existing projects:

```bash
node -v > .nvmrc
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation steps

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ahmedmounib2/my-zsh-setup.git

# 2. Change directory into the repo folder
cd my-zsh-setup

# 3. Make the install script executable
chmod +x setup-zsh.sh

# 4. Run the installer script
./setup-zsh.sh
```

## Optional: One-liner (if you want to avoid cloning manually)

#### You can do it with git clone and run the script in one command like

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahmedmounib2/my-zsh-setup.git && cd my-zsh-setup && chmod +x setup-zsh.sh && ./setup-zsh.sh
```

## üò∞ Uninstall steps

```bash
# Method 1: Clone and run uninstall script
git clone https://github.com/ahmedmounib2/my-zsh-setup.git
cd my-zsh-setup/uninstall-setup-zsh
chmod +x uninstall.sh
./uninstall.sh
```

```bash
#Method 2: One-liner (clone & run uninstall script)
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahmedmounib2/my-zsh-setup/main/uninstall-setup-zsh/uninstall.sh
chmod +x uninstall.sh
./uninstall.sh
```

## üîß Maintenance

**Update components**:

```bash Download and run the installer script

# Configure your Powerlevel10k prompt interactively
p10k configure

# Verify installation
fnm --version && zinit --version
```

```bash
zinit self-update && zinit update --all
fnm install --latest
Uninstall:
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What the Uninstall Script Does Not Remove

The uninstall script is designed to safely and thoroughly clean up your ZSH setup, but a few components are intentionally left untouched:

- nvm
- ~/.zsh_history
- Docker & Docker Compose
- System fzf
- Custom alias files

**Node version not switching**:

````bash
fnm use 20 --install && fnm default 20
````

**Missing plugins**:

```bash
zinit compile --all
```

## Useful commands for testing and managing Node versions with fnm and nvm

### For fnm (Fast Node Manager)

```bash
# List installed Node versions managed by fnm
fnm list

# Show currently active Node version in fnm
fnm current

# Use (activate) a specific Node version with fnm
fnm use 18.20.2

# Set a default Node version in fnm (for future shells)
fnm default 18.20.2

# Check which Node binary is active (gives path)
which node

# Check Node version (current active)
node -v

# To reload shell environment (ZSH example)
exec zsh
```

### For nvm (Node Version Manager)

```bash
# List installed Node versions managed by nvm
nvm ls

# Show currently active Node version in nvm
nvm current

# Use (activate) a specific Node version with nvm
nvm use 18.20.2

# Set a default Node version in nvm (used when opening new shells)
nvm alias default 18.20.2

# Show system Node version (if any)
nvm use system

# Check which Node binary is active (gives path)
which node

# Check Node version (current active)
node -v


# Check if nvm is installed and working
command -v nvm
```

### Testing PATH change and restoring it (to understand how Node version managers work)

```bash
# Print current PATH environment variable
echo $PATH

# Temporarily prepend a custom directory to PATH (like how nvm/fnm do it)
export PATH="/custom/node/path/bin:$PATH"

# Verify PATH change
echo $PATH

# Verify which node is active after PATH change
which node

# Reset PATH to original (example, replace /custom/node/path/bin with your actual value)
export PATH=$(echo $PATH | sed -e 's|/custom/node/path/bin:||')

# Verify reset
echo $PATH

# To simulate fnm being missing (so your .zshrc triggers the fallback to nvm), just rename the fnm binary like this:
mv ~/.local/share/fnm/fnm ~/.local/share/fnm/fnm.bak

# Then restart your shell or run:
exec zsh

# To restore fnm again:
# When you're done testing and want fnm back:
mv ~/.local/share/fnm/fnm.bak ~/.local/share/fnm/fnm
chmod +x ~/.local/share/fnm/fnm  # Just in case
exec zsh
```
